# ArchKernelPanic
This is a simple meme project born from burnout and boredom combined, it'll probably not support windows versions below windows 10 2004 (nor do I intend to do far reaching support).
I've included comments within the project some of them are warnings concerning certain more dangerous parts of the project, Iâ€™ve also included one of my vulnerable driver-based mappers so it can be mapped passed signature enforcement. 
Do make sure to be careful when dealing with anything kernel, this rule also applies to this project.
