# ArchKernelPanic
This is a simple meme project born from burnout and boredom combined, it'll probably not support windows versions below windows 10 2004 (nor do I intend to do far reaching support).
I've included comments within the project some of them are warnings concerning certain more dangerous parts of the project, Iâ€™ve also included one of my vulnerable driver-based mappers so it can be mapped passed signature enforcement. 
Do make sure to be careful when dealing with anything kernel, this rule also applies to this project. To compile this project you will need WDK, you can get a version compatible with your visual studio on msdn.
